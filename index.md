I'm an AI Researcher, currently exploring independent directions.

Previously, I was at Meta for 13 years. From 2020-2025, I was a research lead in the Neural Interfaces Group at Meta Reality Labs pioneering human-AI input using [wrist electromyography](https://www.meta.com/emerging-tech/emg-wearable-technology) (EMG), with a specific focus on decoding handwriting and typing. My work culminated in the launch of the [Meta Neural Band](https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-and-neural-band/), the first ever general-purpose consumer neural interface product, with a [live demo](https://www.youtube.com/live/D97ILdUbYww?si=ClCg_DACoSjyMT4g&t=3134) by Mark Zuckerberg, and has been published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09255-w) and [NeurIPS](https://ai.meta.com/blog/open-sourcing-surface-electromyography-datasets-neurips-2024). Prior to neural interfaces, I worked at Meta AI (FAIR) on vision, reinforcement learning, and ML systems.

I have had the good fortune of getting to experience living in SF, NYC, and London during my 20s. I currently reside in NYC.

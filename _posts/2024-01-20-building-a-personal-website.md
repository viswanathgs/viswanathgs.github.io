Building a personal website is one of the best ways to establish your online presence, especially in academia and tech. Here's why I chose Jekyll and how you can get started too.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for personal websites because:

- **Simple and Fast**: Static sites load quickly and are easy to maintain
- **Version Control**: Your entire website is stored in Git
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll sites
- **Markdown Support**: Write content in Markdown, which is simple and readable
- **Customizable**: Easy to customize with themes and plugins

## Getting Started

1. **Install Jekyll**: Follow the [official installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. **Create a new site**: `jekyll new my-site`
3. **Choose a theme**: Minima is a great starting point
4. **Customize**: Modify `_config.yml` and create your content
5. **Deploy**: Push to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages

## Tips for Success

- Keep your content organized with clear categories
- Use descriptive filenames and titles
- Keep your content organized and up-to-date
- Make sure your site is mobile-friendly
- Regularly update your content

Building a personal website is a rewarding project that can help you showcase your work and connect with others in your field.
